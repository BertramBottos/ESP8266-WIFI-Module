# ESP8266-WIFI-Module

Hi and welcome to my Github. 
This makes it easy to control a power supply remote. 
I used the EPS8266 wifi module to control a power outlet. 
Disclaimer: I take no responsibility for any faults that might oquer. 

# For the not so advanced user
see `/how to setup the poweroutlet` or `/how to setup the Arduine IDE for ESP8266` for a furter elaboration on the setup.
